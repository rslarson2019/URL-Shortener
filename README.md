# URL-Shortener Overview

I did this project to learn more about Javascript. I wanted to learn how I could 
shorten URL's to help my links look neater. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VS code, Github, and a VScode extension called LiveServer to create this software

I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS for this project.
This software is a basic website that will take any URL and shorten it. It links through a website
called tinyurl.com and uses an API there to do shortening
